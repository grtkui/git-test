The Brave Little Mouse

Once upon a time, there was a little mouse who lived in a big, old house. The house was owned by a mean old woman who had a cat named Whiskers. Whiskers was a big, fat cat who loved to chase mice.

One day, the little mouse was playing in the kitchen when he saw Whiskers. Whiskers saw the little mouse too, and he started to chase him. The little mouse ran as fast as he could, but Whiskers was faster.

Just when it seemed like Whiskers was going to catch the little mouse, the little mouse saw a hole in the wall. The little mouse ran through the hole, and Whiskers was too big to fit through.

The little mouse was safe, but he was also lost. He didn't know where he was, and he didn't know how to get home.

The little mouse wandered around the house for a long time. He was starting to get scared. He didn't know what to do.

Just when the little mouse was about to give up hope, he saw a light. The little mouse followed the light, and it led him to a room with a little girl in it.

The little girl was playing with her toys, and she didn't see the little mouse at first. But when she did see him, she smiled.

"Hello, little mouse," the little girl said. "What are you doing here?"

"I'm lost," the little mouse said. "Can you help me find my way home?"

"Of course I can help you," the little girl said. "Come with me."

The little girl took the little mouse to her room, and she gave him some food and water. The little mouse was so grateful.

"Thank you," the little mouse said. "You're so kind."

"You're welcome," the little girl said. "Now, let's get you home."

The little girl took the little mouse back to the kitchen, and she showed him the hole in the wall. The little mouse was so happy to be going home.

"Thank you again," the little mouse said. "I'll never forget your kindness."

The little mouse went through the hole in the wall, and he was home. He was so happy to be back in his own bed.

The little mouse never forgot the little girl who helped him. He knew that there were still kind people in the world, even though there were also mean people like the old woman.

The little mouse lived a long and happy life, and he never forgot the lesson he learned that day: that kindness is always rewarded.
